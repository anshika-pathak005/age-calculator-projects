# ⏳ Age Calculator (Two Versions)

A web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to calculate your age accurately.  

This repository contains two versions showing my progress in learning JavaScript date manipulation and responsive design.

## ❓ Why Two Versions?

- **Version 1 — Date Only**  
  My first attempt — calculates just years, months, and days.  

- **Version 2 — Date + Time**  
  Improved version — adds time calculation (hours, minutes, seconds), better validation, and a fully responsive UI.  

Both are included to show how I started simple and then upgraded the project with new features and cleaner design.


## ✨ Features

### Version 1 – Date Only
- 📅 Input date of birth  
- 📊 Displays age in years, months, and days  
- 🎯 Basic layout to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration  

### Version 2 – Date + Time (Improved)
- ⏱️ Input date and time of birth for second-level accuracy  
- 📊 Displays age in years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds  
- 📱 Responsive design for mobile and desktop  
- 🧹 Cleaner and more polished UI
